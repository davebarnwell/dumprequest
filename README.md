# Dump HTTP request details to the local files

Simple tool to dump HTTP requests to files, which can then be examined to see what data a HTTP
client is sending.

## TODO
- On GET request show recent requests and allow exploring older ones saved in files
- Automatically clean up files older than x days automatically

## Possible future features
- Live update the GET view as new POST/DELETE/PUT/OPTIONS requests come in
- Implement named endpoints to collect related requests together
